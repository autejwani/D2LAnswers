1. Any sorting code can be learned. By using a deep learning model, the algorithm best suited for sorting the particular set of 
   data by comparing sorting solutions with a variety of different datasets. This code includes heuristic design choices because 
   some sorting algorithms are more efficient with a particular size or type of data. You would need to know under what conditions 
   is an algorithm selected to sort a specific set of data.

2. One example is infinite loops. Infinite loops can be solved by break statements or by chnging the conditional that is never 
   reached. Therefore, infinite loops is a good candidate for a deep learning model.

3. Algorithms are ways data is analyzed or modified. Data is the objects that are analyzed or modified. Computation is the 
   process in which the algorithm is applied to the data. If a user has a large dataset to analyze but has less space to 
   store data during processing, a more efficient model should be used.

4. End to End training can be used with autonomous robotics. Since robotics typically recieve data from various sensors, the 
   collected data can be immediately used in the decision making instead of relying on a user to collect data of every possible 
   situation and pre determining the following action.
